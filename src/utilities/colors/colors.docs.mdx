The `sb-main.min.css` stylesheet that has been integrated into your theme includes the styles necessary for each component in this toolkit.

However, if you are building additional components and need access to global style variables, you may access them via CSS custom properties.

## Using Color Variables

CSS custom properties are utilized by wrapping the property in a `var()` function and prepending a `--` like so:

```
.sample-class {
  color: var(--color-primary-regular);
}
```
