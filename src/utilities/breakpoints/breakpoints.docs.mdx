Breakpoints are standardized values for media queries and are used in conjunction with our grid. The small breakpoint has a maximum value, while the medium and large breakpoints have minimum values. Medium and Large breakpoints are additive.

## Values

| name     | value             |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| `small`  | max-width: 640px  |
| `medium` | min-width: 641px  |
| `large`  | min-width: 1025px |

## Breakpoint mixin

### Import

Import the breakpoint mixin — via `@use` syntax — into the Sass partial where you wish to use it.

For example:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```css

@use '../breakpoints/_breakpoints.scss' as *;
```

### Usage

For example, we can set a minimum height of a div when the viewport reaches the large breakpoint like so:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```css
@include breakpoint(large) {
  .sample-div {
    min-height: 4rem;
  }
};
```

The mixin can also be used within a css rule. This can be handy when applying multiple media queries to the same selector. For example:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```css
.sample-div {
  @include breakpoint(medium) {
    min-height: 3rem;
  }

  @include breakpoint(large) {
    min-height: 4rem;
  }
}
```
