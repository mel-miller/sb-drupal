## Grid container

A grid container is implemented by applying the CSS class `sb-grid` to a `<div>` or another HTML sectioning element such as `<main>` or `<section>`. A grid container should contain only grid items as direct descendants.

## Grid items

Grid items must always be direct descendants of the grid container and are typically made up of `<div>` elements. However, there may be use cases where other HTML sectioning elements could be considered such as `<aside>`, `<article>`, or `<section>`.

Each grid item will contain the base class `sb-grid__item`, as well as a modifier class for each breakpoint size based on the following convention: `sb-grid__item--[breakpoint]-[columns]`.

Because medium and large breakpoints each contain 12 columns, it is not necessary to explicitly define a column width for large unless it will have a different value than medium.

For example, a grid item that is full-width at small and 50% at medium and large would have the following markup.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html

<div class="sb-grid__item sb-grid__item--sm-4 sb-grid__item--md-6"></div>
```

**Note:** Grid items that have missing or invalid modifier classes for each breakpoint size will default to the maximum column width for that breakpoint.
