## Drupal Views implementation

There are multiple approaches to implementing a card grid. This recipe provides an example of a article teaser view.

The article content type contains the following fields: image, category, and body text. We will also be using the title, and more link inherent in the content type.

### 1. Build your view as normal with the following settings:

- Format: `Unformatted list`
- Show: `Content | Teaser`

### 2. Create a views unformatted custom template

Create `views-view-unformatted--[view-machine-name].html.twig` with only the following code.

```
<div class="sb-grid">
{% for row in rows %}
  {{- row.content -}}
{% endfor %}
</div>

```

**Note:** This template will strip out standard row attributes and any additional row settings you set within the Views UI.

### 3. Create a node teaser template for any content types that will be included in the view

Create `node--[content-type-machine-name]--teaser.html.twig` with only the following code.

```
{# Preprocess Image #}
{% set image = {
  src: file_url(content.field_article_image[0]['#media'].field_media_image.entity.uri.value),
  alt: content.field_article_image[0]['#media'].field_media_image.alt
}%}

{# Preprocess Link #}
{% set link_text_markup %}
  Read more <span class="visually-hidden"> about {{ label.0 }} <span>
{% endset %}
{% set link = {
  url: url,
  text: link_text_markup
} %}

{% include "@pds/card/card.twig" with {
  kicker_text: content.field_category,
  heading_text: label,
  heading_level: 'h3',
  body_text: content.field_body.0,
  extra_classes: 'sb-sb-grid__item sb-sb-grid__item--sm-4 sb-sb-grid__item--md-4'
}%}


```

**Notes:**

- We are manually setting `h2` as the `heading_level` in this example. However, if these cards will be nested within an h2 on the site, you should then designate the `heading_level` as `h3`.
- The `extra_classes` added to this recipe are specific to a three-across grid. These can be adjusted if you'd like another grid configuration.
- This template includes an accessible "Read More" link by providing additional context for screen reader users.
- If you are using multiple content types to feed into this view, you can either create a teaser template for each, or instead create `node--teaser.html.twig` and implement this markup only for certain node types. The node type can be obtained in Twig via `node.getType()`.
