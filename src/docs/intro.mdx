# Storybook Drupal

This toolkit is a sample Storybook implementation for Drupal.

At this point in time, it is not meant to be a complete example of a design system, but rather an organizational system and collection of example components.

## Toolkit Organization

This toolkit is divided into five main sections.

### Documentation

All documentation that is not for a specific component type is included in this section. It includes setup instructions, usage instructions, and tips for building components.

### Foundations

This section includes stories for displaying the styles for native HTML elements or global styles. Styles will be compiled into `sb-global.css`. Items in this section will not provide Twig files.

### Utilities

This section includes global utilities such as breakpoints, grid, and colors. Some will provide utility classes or mixins. Each will have a story with instructions and usage guidelines. Styles will be compiled into `sb-global.css`. Items in this section will not provide Twig files.

### Elements

This section includes simple UI elements such as buttons or icons. Elements can be used on their own or as part of more complex components.

Styles will be compiled into `sb-global.css`and each items's Twig file will be provided within the `elements` directory of the npm package.

### Components

This section contains more complex UI components such as cards, modals, or navigation.

Styles will be compiled into `sb-global.css`and each items's Twig file will be provided within the `components` directory of the npm package.

### Layouts

Layouts are unstyled (or minimally-styled) components that provide structure to a page. Examples include containers, region layouts, and page templates.

Styles will be compiled into `sb-global.css`and each items's Twig file will be provided within the `layouts` directory of the npm package.
