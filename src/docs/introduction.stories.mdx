# Storybook Drupal

This toolkit is a sample Storybook implementation for Drupal.

At this point in time, it is not meant to be a complete example of a design system, but rather an organizational system and collection of example components.

## Toolkit Organization

This toolkit is divided into five main sections.

### Documentation

All documentation that is not for a specific component is included in this section. It includes setup instructions, usage instructions, and tips for building components.

### Foundations

This section includes stories for displaying the styles for native HTML elements. Styles will be compiled into `sb-main.css`. Components in this section will not have shipped Twig files.

### Utilities

This section includes global utilities such as breakpoints, grid, and colors. Some will provide utility classes or mixins. Each will have a story with instructions and usage guidelines. Styles will be compiled into `sb-main.css`. Components in this section will not have shipped Twig files.

### Components

This section contains the main UI components â€” the building blocks for the user interface. Components can be primitive such as buttons or icons, all the way though complex elements like cards or page templates.

Styles will be compiled into `sb-main.css`, JS will be compiled into `sb-main.js`, and each component's Twig file will be shipped with this toolkit.

### Recipes

Recipes are examples of how to create compositions using the utilities and components. Recipes will contain a story, sample data, and clear instructions about how to implement the compositions in your site. No assets will be shipped from recipes.
