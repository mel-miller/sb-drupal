# SB Drupal

This toolkit is a sample Storybook implementation for Drupal.

At this point in time, it is not meant to be a complete example of a design system, but rather an organizational system and collection of example components.

## Toolkit Organization

This toolkit is divided into five main sections.

### Documentation

All documentation that is not for a specific component is included in this section. It includes setup instructions, usage instructions, and tips for building components.

### Foundations

This section includes components for displaying the styles for native HTML elements. Styles will be compiled into `sb-main.css`. Components in this section will not have shipped Twig files.

### Utilities

This section includes global utility components such as breakpoints, grid, and colors. Some will provide utility classes or mixins. Each will have a story with instructions and usage guidelines. Styles will be compiled into `sb-main.css`. Components in this section will not have shipped Twig files.
