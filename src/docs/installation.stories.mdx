# Drupal Installation

<h2 class="subtitle">
	This toolkit is designed to be consumed directly within a custom Drupal theme
	via Composer
</h2>

## Composer configuration

Instructions will vary based on how you are managing your theme — either as part of your site's repository, or required from a separate repository. Both methods are outlined below.

<hr />

### Method 1: The theme code is directly integrated within the site's repo

When using Method 1, the following Composer commands should be run from the project's root directory.

#### Add the repository information for the sb-drupal package

Add the following to the site's `composer.json` "repositories" section.

```
{
  "type": "vcs",
  "url": "https://github.com/mel-miller/sb-drupal.git"
}
```

#### Require Drupal [Components!](https://www.drupal.org/project/components) module

This will allow us to register a Twig namespace and directly import PDS twig templates into the theme templates.

```
composer require drupal/components
```

#### Require [composer-installers-extender](https://packagist.org/packages/oomphinc/composer-installers-extender) package

This plugin extends `composer/installers` and will allow us to customize install paths for custom package types.

```
composer require oomphinc/composer-installers-extender
```

#### Configure the "extra" section to accept "design-system" as a package type

This will install the `sb-drupal` package as its own subdirectory within the theme directory.

```
"extra": {
  "installer-types": [
    "design-system"
  ],
  "installer-paths": {
    "web/themes/custom/THEMENAME/{$name}": [
      "type:design-system"
    ]
  }
}

```

#### Require [sb-drupal](https://github.com/mel-miller/sb-drupal) as a dev dependency

This package contains all assets necessary to use these components within a Drupal theme. This directory should be committed along with the rest of your theme files.

```
composer require --dev mel-miller/sb-drupal

```

<hr />

### Method 2: The theme is required via its own separate repository

These instructions will walk you through setting up a `composer.json` file for a theme with its own repository. When using Method 2, the following Composer commands should be run from within the theme's directory.

#### Configure "repositories" section

This will allow us to require any packages hosted on drupal.org, as well as requiring the `mel-miller/sb-drupal` package.

```
"repositories": [
  {
    "type": "composer",
    "url": "https://packages.drupal.org/8"
  },
  {
    "type": "vcs",
    "url": "https://github.com/mel-miller/sb-drupal"
  }
]

```

#### Require Drupal [Components!](https://www.drupal.org/project/components) module

This will allow us to register a Twig namespace and directly import PDS twig templates into the theme templates.

```
composer require drupal/components
```

#### Require [composer-installers-extender](https://packagist.org/packages/oomphinc/composer-installers-extender) package

This plugin extends `composer/installers` and will allow us to customize install paths for custom package types.

```
composer require oomphinc/composer-installers-extender
```

#### Configure the "extra" section to accept "design-system" as a package type

This will install the `sb-drupal` package as its own subdirectory within the theme directory.

```
"extra": {
  "installer-types": [
    "design-system"
  ],
  "installer-paths": {
    "web/themes/contrib/THEMENAME/{$name}": [
      "type:design-system"
    ]
  }
}

```

#### Require [sb-drupal](https://github.com/mel-miller/sb-drupal) as a dev dependency

This package contains all assets necessary to use these components within a Drupal theme. This directory should be committed along with the rest of your theme files.

```
composer require --dev mel-miller/sb-drupal

```

#### Add post-install and post-update scripts

This will keep your theme directory clean from unnecessary Drupal core files when running Composer commands from within the theme directory.

```
"scripts": {
  "post-install-cmd": [
    "rm -rf core/",
    "rm -rf modules/",
    "rm -rf profiles/",
    "rm -rf themes/",
    "rm -rf vendor/",
    "rm -rf web/",
    "rm -rf .gitattributes"
  ],
    "post-update-cmd": [
    "rm -rf core/",
    "rm -rf modules/",
    "rm -rf profiles/",
    "rm -rf themes/",
    "rm -rf vendor/",
    "rm -rf web/",
    "rm -rf .gitattributes"
  ]
}

```
