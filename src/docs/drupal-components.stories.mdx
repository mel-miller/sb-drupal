# Creating Drupal-Ready Components

<h2 class="subtitle">
	Tips to build components that will easily integrate into your Drupal theme
</h2>

In addition to providing thorough documentation for each component you write — such as sample code for templates and field-mapping instructions for blocks or other entities — there are additional methods to enable smooth consumption of components into your Drupal theme.

The following tips center around the concept of writing components that are designed for Drupal, but will render accurately in Storybook.

## 1. Create sample data as objects when necessary to match Drupal

For field types that you know are objects within Drupal (links, images, etc...), you should replicate that object shape in your Storybook sample data (args) as much as possible.

```js
args: {
  image: {
    src: 'demo-images/placeimg_360_240_nature.jpeg',
    alt: 'Beach at sunset.',
  },
},

```

## 2. Attribute Simulation

## 3. Conditionally render for Storybook

There are instances where you may need to render something differently in Storybook than in Drupal. The `db_is_active` variable can be used to achieve this as this variable is not natively set within Storybook.

A potential use case is when you know you're dealing with a formatted long text field in Drupal, but you don't want to have to recreate that within your Stroybook sample data. You can wrap your sample data in a `<p>` tag within Storybook, but let Drupal handle the actual formatted text when rendered within the site.

There's an example of this technique within the Card component.

```
{% if body_text %}
<div class="sb-card__bodytext">
  {# Wrap in paragraph tag if not Drupal site #}
  {% if not db_is_active %}
    <p>{{ body_text }}</p>
  {% else %}
    {{ body_text }}
  {% endif %}
</div>
{% endif %}

```
