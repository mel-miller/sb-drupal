## Purpose

Buttons are used to trigger an action — such as closing a modal, submitting a form, or expanding a dropdown menu.

### Buttons vs Links

Buttons and links are distinct elements with distinct purposes — buttons are used to initiate actions, while links are used to navigate to another page, elsewhere on the same page, or to an external destination. Those distinctions are extremely important for assistive technology users. See [Links VS Buttons: A Perennial Problem](https://www.digitala11y.com/links-vs-buttons-a-perennial-problem/) for an in-depth explanation.

## Drupal Theme Implementation

Because Drupal already provides templates for buttons and other input elements, it is often not necessary to provide custom markup. Instead, you would just add the provided button classes to the `attributes` array via a preprocess function or a twig template.
