## Purpose

Links use the anchor `<a>` element to allow the user to navigate to another location, initiate an email, or initiate a phone call. This particular component is a standalone link that can be used as a CTA within your layout or as part of another component.

### Links vs Buttons

Buttons and links are distinct elements with distinct purposes â€” buttons are used to initiate actions, while links are used to navigate to another page, elsewhere on the same page, or to an external destination. Those distinctions are extremely important for assistive technology users. See [Links VS Buttons: A Perennial Problem](https://www.digitala11y.com/links-vs-buttons-a-perennial-problem/) for an in-depth explanation.

## Drupal Theme Implementation

The example below illustrates how to use the included Twig template to add a secondary link to another Twig template (field or block, for example).

```
{% include '@namespace/link/link.twig' with {
	variant: 'secondary',
	href: '/path/to/destination',
	text: 'Link text goes here'
} %}
```
