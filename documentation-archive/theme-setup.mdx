## Local development setup for theme

1. From the root of your Drupal theme, run `npm init -y` to create a `package.json` file.
2. Install the vendor-copy npm package by running `npm install --save-dev vendor-copy`.
3. Add a "vendorCopy" section to your `package.json` file. It should look like this:

```
"vendorCopy": [
  {
    "from": "node_modules/@mel-miller/sb-drupal/dist/",
    "to": "sb-drupal"
  },
]
```

4. Add a postinstall script to your `package.json` file to copy the assets after installing dependencies. It should look like this:

```
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "vendor-copy"
  }
```

5. Install the toolkit as a dependency by running `npm install sb-drupal`.

## Theme integration

1. Add a library definition to your theme's `.libraries.yml` file. It should look like this:

```
sb-drupal:
  css:
    theme:
      sb-drupal/css/sb-global.css: {}
  js:
    sb-drupal/js/sb-global.js: {}
  dependencies:
    - core/jquery
```

2. Include the library in your theme's `.info.yml` file.

```
libraries:
  - THEMENAME/sb-drupal
```

3. Configure ckeditor to use the toolkit styles by adding the following to your theme's `.info.yml` file.

```
ckeditor5-stylesheets:
  - 'sb-drupal/css/sb-global.css'
```

4. Configure component namespaces in your theme's `.info.yml` file.

```
components:
  namespaces:
    elements: 'sb-drupal/elements'
    components: 'sb-drupal/components'
    layouts: 'sb-drupal/layouts'
```
